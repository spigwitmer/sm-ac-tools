This is a repository of my earlier work with ITG2 and Pump It Up Pro
asset tools.  It's here for archival purposes and will most likely 
not get any love after this.  I'm proud of the effort that I and
plenty of others have made back in the day to customize our favorite
games to our liking, but I am definitley not proud of the code I
wrote for it.

I found the source sitting on an old portable harddrive that I decided to
hook up and explore for shits 'n giggles. 

What's missing is the Pump Pro Encore addon 
toolset that apparently I couldn't find on the same drive, and 
unfortunately might be lost forever (I was a real dumbass back in 
the day with the whole not keeping notes and using source control).
